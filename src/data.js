        content: `Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.`,

        title: `If Michael Bay & Zack Snyder had a baby`,
        content: `Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.

        What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.
        
        This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.
        
        And guess what? It works. Mostly.
        
        Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing "comic book to screen" adaptation.
        
        Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!`,

        title: `Fast paced action and kinda fun`,
        content: `In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.

        This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.
        
        But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of "who is really a hero?" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.
        
        If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.
        
        I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!`,

        content: `"Ticket to Paradise" is the clear example that the trailer is better than the movie itself. The script does not bring anything new to romantic comedies, it rushes to take the already known formula and fill the plot with the typical clichés. Julia Roberts and George Clooney offer simple performances without much charm, the secondary characters are more endearing as is the case with Wren Butler played by Billie Lourd. The filming locations are extraordinary and the cinematography makes them look even more beautiful. Returning to the script, it fails to catch on and as entertainment it doesn't go that far either. One of the worst moments is the terrible CGI with which a dolphin that appears on the screen for a few seconds was created. Movie to see once and not repeat.`,

It really looks like another comedy made quickly for Netflix. I don't recommend spending money on this, better wait for the streaming or TV... unless you are depressed, unhappy, down on your luck in your private life and quickly need some positive, optimistic and light entertainment. 3/10 for normal viewers, 8/10 if you're depressed and sad.`,

        Ol Parker's direction is also really good, the location constantly looks gorgeous and it maintains a solid pace throughout. The music by Lorne Balfe works perfectly for the film's tone, so grand and swoon worthy.`,

        content: `Firstly, Rose is a better person than me because I'd have done what that man told her and spent the rest of my days in prison, in peace. 7/10, this is the rating I'd give if I hadn't watched a lot of horrors so that's what I'm sticking with, it reminds me so much of The Ring and has a lot of the orthodox methods other horror movies used to incite fear. So nothing groundbreaking, still, for the most part they are stilly effective. Only problem is you can figure out how it's probably gonna end. I went into this pretty dozy but the first scare woke me straight up. There's a lot of jump scares and they have the desired affect then they start to get repetitive, which doesn't bode well for the end of the movie because it feels amazing at first the quickly starts to feel unimaginative as the movie keeps depending on the same old tricks. Unfortunately horror movies need to peak towards or at the end so that they leave you with a lasting impression to make you afraid to sleep in the dark. It however still is the best horror I've seen so far this year by quite some margin. I also really loved the title sequence at the beginning of the movie as well. The 'sanatorium + demon possession' horror formula is always a welcome for me.

        Funny thing about horrors is how tough people try to act afterwards, I sat close to this couple that were squirming at literally every jumpscare, then at the end of the movie both went "it's probably like a 4/10" "yeah, horror movies just aren't scary anymore" and that really just made my day lmfao.`,

        title: `An Uneasy Study On Madness Passed On Through Trauma`,
        content: `It's hard to shake the uneasy feeling of this film. It's grim and foggy but at the core is the idea that when trauma is passed from person to person it will consume you. With that in hand, director Parker Finn plays on the idea that most people who suffer through awful events in life will have their past consume them if they don't confront them. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a clinical psychologist who surrounds herself with the mentally broken people of New Jersey (add your own joke here). You can basically connect the dots as to how she became good at her job. One fateful day a girl comes into her office and gruesomely ends her own life. That launches Sosie's journey into her own madness. Slowly seeing things in her life. Or being haunted by voices of her past. Whatever it is knows her greatest pains. And exploits it. The mystery isn't completely satisfying to solve, but the constant moments of jerky jumpscares definitely make you feel on edge.

        What I particularly like is the uneasy camera work. It isn't afraid to linger long within the frame. Nor add dutch angles. It plays like 70's cinema. The frames make you squirm. Though much of the scares are telegraphed. This isn't a slasher gory flick. It's really a psychological mind bender. As mentioned before, the resolution won't make you happy. But then, it really is watching someone work through their own mental illness. If that is interesting to you, this is the movie for you.`,

        content: `I can't stop smiling at the mastery of filmmaking on display in Smile. The directing is topnotch. All of the technical aspects are pristine, especially the sound design. The musical score greatly enhances the mood. Even something as simple as transition shots are stunning. It's visually elite.

        I can't stop smiling at how ridiculously scary this movie is. I'm a 37-year-old man who has seen hundreds of horror flicks of all types. And yet this movie had me on edge from beginning to end. At points I was paranoid that someone was standing off to the side in the shadows of the theater. It continued afterwards, when I was startled by what turned out to be the shadow of the car behind me. And then again when the curbside lady brought my food out. I can't remember the last time a movie did this to me.
        
        I can't stop smiling at stumbling upon what might be my favorite movie of the year. I went in, as usual, without watching any trailers or looking up reviews/ratings. I had no expectations and was fully blown away. I was either smiling or had my jaw dropped for most of the runtime.
        
        I can't stop smiling at how impactful some of these scenes and moments are. I will never forget them. They are seared into my brain forever. Whoever came up with them, whoever designed them has to be some combination of genius and possibly disturbed. I love it. Maybe I'm disturbed too.
        
        I jumped about 20 times. None of the jump scares are cheap. They are all creative and earned. The few that are predictable still startle. I sometimes laughed afterwards at how bad it got me.
        
        I had a blast with Smile. It's not for the faint of heart or horror novices. For everyone else, for horror fans, for people who want high-quality cinema, this is the movie for you. (2 viewings, opening Friday UltraScreen 9/30/2022, UltraScreen 10/6/2022)`,

        content: `After the huge surprise of the awesome horror movie Smile, I'm brought right back down to earth with Prey for the Devil. Right back to where the expectation is the vast majority of horror flicks will be terrible.

        There are two different routes to me giving a movie such a low score. One is that the movie is actively bad, laughable, filled with things to rip on. That's not the case with Prey for the Devil. It takes the second route, the one where the movie has nothing of value. Nothing about it is good.
        
        This movie does a horrendous job at making you care. About anything. I couldn't keep track of how many times I thought to myself, "I DON'T CARE." Emotional moments, I don't care. Major horror moments, I don't care. Climax with stakes, I don't care.
        
        If I were to rate the scariness, it's a two out of ten. Zero tension, zero suspense. It made me jump maybe three times. I watched these supposedly scary scenes and felt absolutely nothing. I also think I might be done with exorcism horror flicks. A couple come out each year and they're usually useless.
        
        In the end, Prey for the Devil is almost a complete waste of time. It might be good to reset expectations so I could be as pleasantly surprised the next time a movie like Smile comes along. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 10/27/2022)`,

        title: `Let... me... in!`,
        content: `Slow paced with a couple jump scares, probably a few shy from being too many but most still genuinely startled me. I think that was due to the movie maintaining a constant eerie aura, it doesn't lighten up at any point. The somewhat novel story was decent, as well as the acting, but not entirely spectacular. Thought Smile was the best horror this year because it was an actual horror instead of just throwing some gore into psychological thriller; Smile was more of a fun horror to jump out of your seat with your friend and this was more of a scare you to death horror. I constantly had a chill in my tummy and had forgot what that felt like. Maybe this scares me more than Smile did because that was more reminiscent of other horrors like the Ring.

        Over recent years I stopped watching horrors because new ones didn't scare me anymore and I thought oh maybe I'm just older; but now that I've found something one that's actually scared me to my core I don't know why I missed this. I think exorcist horrors are spine-chilling because demons are actually real to you especially if you grew up around church, unlike let's say vampire, psychological or zombie slasher.
        
        Didn't give it a 10/10 mainly because plot progresses pretty generically, even the twist felt lazy writing, but the fact that this is scary is really all you could ever ask a horror movie for. It could have been more graphic too, doesn't have a lot of images that stick with you and maybe the pg13 rating was limiting. A few unanswered questions i.e. Why Sister Ann was chosen. The story also lacked depth, not that it needed much though; I love that the runtime is relatively short and it uses the little it has effectively. Loved that the movie leaves an impression, not just to scare you while watching it but for you to think about it later before you sleep.
        
        Also, hopefully not a spoiler but that scene in the ambulance with the rosary was so bad ass, the demon knew he was bossing it with that pose waiting for the door to open. Favorite scene even though it's another were we whisked past the gore.
        
        I'm so happy this lived up to my expectations because it was the first time I was excited for a horror in years and it delivered so check it out. Reminded me why I used to enjoy horrors as a kid.`,

        We've seen the women overcoming oppression a thousand times, whilst it's obviously vital and any decent person agrees women deserve the same opportunities, I struggle with the logic that women can't do exorcisms as there's no physicality it's just waving a book, cross and some water.
        
        The acting is severely mediocre, the lead is someone I've known for years, at one point she looked extremely promising but she's definitely not a very good actor, very weak performance and poor delivery. Was disappointed massively in someone who's been around so long being so basic.
        
        Then there's the twist, it's a sad tired cliche at this point that made it so predictable, plus the thing was you just didn't care, you can't just rely on the child being young to get viewers support, lazy writing and basic execution.
        
        It's set up for a completely needless sequel that if it happens it'll be straight to dvd for half the price of one ticket.
        
        Horror is such a good genre, yet people can't imagine some fresh stories? I have so much more respect seeing people try new things and failing that people making these kinda movies over and over.`,

        This is a thoroughly well-directed movie, which was shocking to me. There is quite a bit of thoughtful camera placement that visually emphasises how the characters are feeling about the events that unfold around them.
        
        Musical numbers are a surprisingly difficult thing to get right, and I thought this movie managed to pull off some pretty spectacular ones. There is a great deal of variety to the visual presentation of each musical sequence, with characters and camera moving around with some fun choreography.
        
        I could tell that these filmmakers were really trying to make this movie as good as it could be. Their effort shows and mostly pays off.
        
        As for plot, it's very narratively slight; it's full of contrivances and forced conflicts that never once felt substantial or surprising or meaningful. Because of this, I'll probably be forgetting about this movie very quickly.
        
        There's also a sequence in which a montage is shown made up of scenes from earlier in the movie, and I thought it was hilariously clumsy in how it was put together.
